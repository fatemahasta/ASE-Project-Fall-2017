## Introduction:
A Web portal is an exclusively designed web application that can provide information from different sources and the content that displayed varies depending upon the intended user and the intended purpose. UMKC Attendance & Feedback is a portal which can be used by UMKC students and professors. Students can submit the attendance and feedback through this portal upon enrolment to their respective courses for the semester. And professors can track the data related to each student’s presence, feedback and suggestions from the portal.

## Project Goal and Objectives:

### Overall Goal
The existing UMKC Attendance Application enables students to submit code for attendance submission. This existing application can be enhanced as a web portal for the
students to register. Depending upon the term and courses enrolled, students can easily have access to view the calendar, corresponding schedule for the date and submit the feedback for their presence. Each professor can pull out information regarding the attendance and feedback. So, the main agenda of this is to create a portal collectively which makes it flexible for students to submit the attendance & feedback instead of spending time in fetching links of the forms and submitting it
externally. Initially every intended user (student, professor and admin) must register and login to access the portal. Upon login, each student should submit the details of the enrolled courses for the semester. The student can then view a scheduled calendar which will display the courses enrolled in. On clicking on the date, the user can submit the feedback and attendance form. The professors can login to the portal and can download/export the sheets for the attendance and feedback depending upon the submission received from the students for a date. The admin has rights to view access and maintain the entire data of the application
